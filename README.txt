Star Wars Frogger!

This is a game I created for Lecture 3 of the Udacity Nanodegree for Front End Web Development.  Udacity provided some assets and the basic game engine and structure and left a bunch of loose ends to tie up as part of the class.  

I filled in the holes of the code and tried to add a little personalization by changing the characters and adding a level-up scheme.  I do collision detection with the player and the speeders, checking if they occupy the same relative space on the canvas.  I do the same for the players and the gems.  If you reach a gem, you get a new character and start back at the lower part of the screen.  

The goal of the game is to navigate your Star Wars character to the gems on the screen.  Watch out for storm troopers on speeders!  Every time you grab a gem you level up to a new star wars character. Use the arrow keys.
